      <p>2014 was a year of significant transition for Amazon’s<br>Digital music business. On June 12, millions of U.S.<br>Prime members received unlimited access to a million<br>songs at no additional cost.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Create Deeper Relationships with Customers</h3>
        <P>Since 2013, digital music download sales have declined and now a sizable proportion of the music industry’s revenue is made up by on‐demand streaming services. For Amazon, this signaled a rapid change in music consumption habits.</P>
        <P>Our challenge was to evolve with customers and enter the highly competitive on‐demand streaming music segment in the U.S.</P>
        <P>Prime Music would offer a limited selection of a million songs and catalogue titles (at least six months old), exclusive for Prime members to stream and download. With this new benefit we hoped to create deeper relationships with Amazon customers.</P>
